The notation `titanic.deactivate()` is effectively passing titanic itself as the first argument to its own deactivate method...  Similarly when we played with integers above we used `x.__add__(2)`, this method in the int class might look like `def __add__(self, number)`, i.e. it takes itself as the first number in the addition.
