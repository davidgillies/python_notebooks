# Python Notebooks

I started a basic set of introductory notebooks for Python newbies, but never got as far as I hoped!  You can read these notebooks direct in Github as it renders the notebooks.  If you want to use them more interactively you can clone set on to your machine and set them up as follows:

If you click on your Start Menu on Windows and select 'All Programs', click on the Anaconda folder, then click on IPython (Py 2.7) Notebook.  This will start a command prompt screen, just ignore it, then it will start a tab in your browser with a folder and file listing.  

The choice of this location is noted in the properties of the shortcut.  You can instead right click on the IPython (Py 2.7) Notebook shortcut in the menu and select properties, you can then change this location if you wish by editing the 'Start in' line.

Then startup the notebooks.  It will open a tab on your browser with all the notebooks listed.  Follow the order below.  Any troubles, hassle Sharreen!
